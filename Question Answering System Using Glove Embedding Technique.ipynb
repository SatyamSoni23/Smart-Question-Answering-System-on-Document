    "pdf_txt = \"\"\"Life insurance is a legally enforceable contract between two parties both of whom are legally qualified to contract. It is therefore, necessary that the terms and conditions of the agreement must be suitably documented in a manner that would make it clear that both parties to the contract are Ad- idem i.e., of the same mind. Ad-Idem means that both the parties understand the same thing in the same sense or are of the same mind on the same subject. There must be consensus or Ad-Idem between the parties to the contract.\n",
    "This is possible provided all the terms and conditions, rights and duties - privileges and obligations are properly documented in terms which can be clearly interpreted in a court of law. Between two human beings sometime silence means an acceptance. But as the insurer is a legal personality entitled to contract verbal discussion between parties to the contract is not possible and hence there is a need for documentation.\n",
    "Insurance is also a contract of utmost good faith and enforced only in the distant future. It is therefore necessary that the declarations made by both the parties should be put in black and white for future reference. Any suppression, willful and material shall make the contract void. The insured, therefore, has a duty to declare all that he knows about himself, his health, his financial status in answering questions contained in the proposal form and other ancillary documents which may be required by the insurer.\n",
    "Age is an important factor in deciding the quantum of premium against a policy. The document proving the age, i.e. age proof must be reliable and the insured has to undertake as to its truthfulness.\n",
    "Non-standard age proofs are those which are comparatively less reliable and therefore the insurer accepts them with a pinch of salt. In other words the insurer takes certain precautions before accepting such age proofs as final.\n",
    "Proof of income is the document may become necessary whenever the sum proposed is very high. Normally a sum proposed which is seven to eight times of the declared income is acceptable for insurance. But proposals do come to the insurer when the known source of income of the proposer is much less compared to the amount of insurance desired. A service holder normally does not face this problem as his sources of income are verifiable.\n",
    "In case of business people, the assessed income is at times much less compared to what is a desirable income for the amount of insurance desired. In such cases the insurer at times calls for assessed income tax returns, or Chartered Accountant’s certificate etc. Such precautions are necessary to eliminate the possibility of moral hazard.\n",
    "Policy Contract is the policy document is a detailed document and it is the Evidence of the insurance contract which mentions all the terms and conditions of the insurance. The insured buys not the policy contract, but the right to the sum of money and its future delivery. The insurer on its part promises to pay a sum of money, provided of course the insured keeps its part of promise of paying the installments of premium as scheduled.\n",
    "The pre-amble to the insurance contract makes the above statement clear and states that this policy is issued subject to the conditions and privileges printed on the back of the policy. The endorsements placed on the policy shall also be part of the policy and it also makes a reference to the proposal form saying that that the statements given in the proposal form are the basis of the contract.\n",
    "The schedule which is printed on the policy document identifies the office which has issued the policy. It states the name of the policyholder, the date of commencement of the policy, an identification number of the policy called policy number. This number is extremely useful for making any reference to the insurer relating to this policy. This shall avoid needless delay.\n",
    "Beneficiary’s name is also mentioned along with address.\n",
    "It is necessary to check that it is correct and any mistake should be immediately pointed out for correction. A mistake in the address may misdirect the premium notices and any other future correspondence. It also states the name of the nominee and the date upto which premium has to be paid. The schedule goes on to mention, the type of policy, on the happening of which, the sum assured is payable and to whom it is payable. It of course also mentions when and how long the premium is to be paid.\n",
    "The policy document is signed by an official of the insurer and dated and stamped as per the provision of the Stamp Act to make it a completely legally enforceable document.\n",
    "An assignment of a policy in favour of another person or institution can be effected by an endorsement on the policy. Re-assignment can also be done by a subsequent endorsement on the same policy.As a nomination is automatically cancelled due to an assignment, after re-assignment, it is necessary to make a fresh nomination.\n",
    "In Duplicate policy a policy document is a valuable document and can be used for mortgage etc. Loss of policy document does not absolve the insurer from the liability of payment of policy proceeds when the claim arises. The claim can be settled on the claimants, furnishing an indemnity bond jointly with one surety.\n",

    "\n",
    "Glove is an alternate approch to build word embeddings using matrix factorization techniques on the word-word co-occurance matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "A large matrix of co-occurrence information is constructed and you count each “word” (the rows), and how frequently we see this word in some “context” (the columns) in a large corpus. Usually, we scan our corpus in the following manner: for each term, we look for context terms within some area defined by a window-size before the term and a window-size after the term. Also, we give less weight for more distant words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of “contexts” is, of course, large, since it is essentially combinatorial in size. So then we factorize this matrix to yield a lower-dimensional matrix, where each row now yields a vector representation for each word. In general, this is done by minimizing a “reconstruction loss”. This loss tries to find the lower-dimensional representations which can explain most of the variance in the high-dimensional data."
