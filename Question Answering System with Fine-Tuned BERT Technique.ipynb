It is therefore, necessary that the terms and conditions of the agreement must be suitably documented in a manner that would make it clear that both parties to the contract are Ad- idem i.e., of the same mind. Ad-Idem means that both the parties understand the same thing in the same sense or are of the same mind on the same subject. There must be consensus or Ad-Idem between the parties to the contract.\n","This is possible provided all the terms and conditions, rights and duties - privileges and obligations are properly documented in terms which can be clearly interpreted in a court of law. Between two human beings sometime silence means an acceptance. But as the insurer is a legal personality entitled to contract verbal discussion between parties to the contract is not possible and hence there is a need for documentation.\n","Insurance is also a contract of utmost good faith and enforced only in the distant future. It is therefore necessary that the declarations made by both the parties should be put in black and white for future reference. Any suppression, willful and material shall make the contract void. The insured, therefore, has a duty to declare all that he knows about himself, his health, his financial status in answering questions contained in the proposal form and other ancillary documents which may be required by the insurer.\n","Age is an important factor in deciding the quantum of premium against a policy. The document proving the age, i.e. age proof must be reliable and the insured has to undertake as to its truthfulness.\n","Non-standard age proofs are those which are comparatively less reliable and therefore the insurer accepts them with a pinch of salt. In other words the insurer takes certain precautions before accepting such age proofs as final.\n","Proof of income is the document may become necessary whenever the sum proposed is very high. Normally a sum proposed which is seven to eight times of the declared income is acceptable for insurance. But proposals do come to the insurer when the known source of income of the proposer is much less compared to the amount of insurance desired. A service holder normally does not face this problem as his sources of income are verifiable.\n","In case of business people, the assessed income is at times much less compared to what is a desirable income for the amount of insurance desired. In such cases the insurer at times calls for assessed income tax returns, or Chartered Accountant’s certificate etc. Such precautions are necessary to eliminate the possibility of moral hazard.\n","Policy Contract is the policy document is a detailed document and it is the Evidence of the insurance contract which mentions all the terms and conditions of the insurance. The insured buys not the policy contract, but the right to the sum of money and its future delivery. The insurer on its part promises to pay a sum of money, provided of course the insured keeps its part of promise of paying the installments of premium as scheduled.\n","The pre-amble to the insurance contract makes the above statement clear and states that this policy is issued subject to the conditions and privileges printed on the back of the policy. The endorsements placed on the policy shall also be part of the policy and it also makes a reference to the proposal form saying that that the statements given in the proposal form are the basis of the contract.\n","The schedule which is printed on the policy document identifies the office which has issued the policy. It states the name of the policyholder, the date of commencement of the policy, an identification number of the policy called policy number. This number is extremely useful for making any reference to the insurer relating to this policy. This shall avoid needless delay.\n","Beneficiary’s name is also mentioned along with address.\n","It is necessary to check that it is correct and any mistake should be immediately pointed out for correction. A mistake in the address may misdirect the premium notices and any other future correspondence. It also states the name of the nominee and the date upto which premium has to be paid. The schedule goes on to mention, the type of policy, on the happening of which, the sum assured is payable and to whom it is payable. It of course also mentions when and how long the premium is to be paid.\n","The policy document is signed by an official of the insurer and dated and stamped as per the provision of the Stamp Act to make it a completely legally enforceable document.\n","An assignment of a policy in favour of another person or institution can be effected by an endorsement on the policy. Re-assignment can also be done by a subsequent endorsement on the same policy.As a nomination is automatically cancelled due to an assignment, after re-assignment, it is necessary to make a fresh nomination.\n","In Duplicate policy a policy document is a valuable document and can be used for mortgage etc. Loss of policy document does not absolve the insurer from the liability of payment of policy proceeds when the claim arises. The claim can be settled on the claimants, furnishing an indemnity bond jointly with one surety.\n","If a policy is irrevocably lost, a duplicate policy can be issued, after following a certain procedure like the insurer satisfies itself of the circumstances leading to loss and being so satisfied the insurer insists upon an advertisement in a news paper, production of an indemnity bond and payment of policy preparation charges and there after a duplicate policy is issued.\n","Generally nomination is made at the time of taking a policy. In case it is not done, it is possible to make nomination subsequently by an endorsement on the policy. It is also possible to change a nomination subsequently by an endorsement. After marriage, such change in nomination is normally required.\n","Life insurance being a legally enforceable contract, needs to be documented with details of the rights and obligations of the parties to the contract. Proposal form duly filled in and signed by the proposer is the first document which forms the basis of the contract.\n","Every time, the insured pays the premium, he receives a premium receipt. The premium needs to be paid in time, non- payment of premium leads to policy-lapses. Re-instatement of the cover is called revival of the policy.\n","If the policy is not revived, the policy can become a paid up policy for a reduced sum assured under certain conditions.\n","The policy document mentions in detail all the rights and obligations of the policyholder. The agent is advised to explain the various provisions of the policy to the policyholder.\n","The wordings in the policy document are of technical nature and hence the need for explaining. If there are certain endorsements on the policy, that need to be explained too.\n","It needs to be explained that the policy is a valuable document and needs to be kept in safe custody and in the

So, training a BERT model from scratch on a small dataset would result in overfitting.\n","\n","So, it is better to use a pre-trained BERT model that was trained on a huge dataset, as a starting point. We can then further train the model on our relatively smaller dataset and this process is known as model fine-tuning."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8x8J4yVMcvre"},"source":["*

It is therefore, necessary that the terms and conditions of the agreement must be suitably documented in a manner that would make it clear that both parties to the contract are Ad- idem i.e., of the same mind. Ad-Idem means that both the parties understand the same thing in the same sense or are of the same mind on the same subject. There must be consensus or Ad-Idem between the parties to the contract.\\nThis is possible provided all the terms and conditions, rights and duties - privileges and obligations are properly documented in terms which can be clearly interpreted in a court of law. Between two human beings sometime silence means an acceptance. But as the insurer is a legal personality entitled to contract verbal discussion between parties to the contract is not possible and hence there is a need for documentation.\\nInsurance is also a contract of utmost good faith and enforced only in the distant future. It is therefore necessary that the declarations made by both the parties should be put in black and white for future reference. Any suppression, willful and material shall make the contract void. The insured, therefore, has a duty to declare all that he knows about himself, his health, his financial status in answering questions contained in the proposal form and other ancillary documents which may be required by the insurer.\\nAge is an important factor in deciding the quantum of premium against a policy. The document proving the age, i.e. age proof must be reliable and the insured has to undertake as to its truthfulness.\\nNon-standard age proofs are those which are comparatively less reliable and therefore the insurer accepts them with a pinch of salt. In other words the insurer takes certain precautions before accepting such age proofs as final.\\nProof of income is the document may become necessary whenever the sum proposed is very high. Normally a sum proposed which is seven to eight times of the declared income is acceptable for insurance. But proposals do come to the insurer when the known source of income of the proposer is much less compared to the amount of insurance desired. A service holder normally does not face this problem as his sources of income are verifiable.\\nIn case of business people, the assessed income is at times much less compared to what is a desirable income for the amount of insurance desired. In such cases the insurer at times calls for assessed income tax returns, or Chartered Accountant’s certificate etc. Such precautions are necessary to eliminate the possibility of moral hazard.\\nPolicy Contract is the policy document is a detailed document and it is the Evidence of the insurance contract which mentions all the terms and conditions of the insurance. The insured buys not the policy contract, but the right to the sum of money and its future delivery. The insurer on its part promises to pay a sum of money, provided of course the insured keeps its part of promise of paying the installments of premium as scheduled.\\nThe pre-amble to the insurance contract makes the above statement clear and states that this policy is issued subject to the conditions and privileges printed on the back of the policy. The endorsements placed on the policy shall also be part of the policy and it also makes a reference to the proposal form saying that that the statements given in the proposal form are the basis of the contract.\\nThe schedule which is printed on the policy document identifies the office which has issued the policy. It states the name of the policyholder, the date of commencement of the policy, an identification number of the policy called policy number. This number is extremely useful for making any reference to the insurer relating to this policy. This shall avoid needless delay.\\nBeneficiary’s name is also mentioned along with address.\\nIt is necessary to check that it is correct and any mistake should be immediately pointed out for correction. A mistake in the address may misdirect the premium notices and any other future correspondence. It also states the name of the nominee and the date upto which premium has to be paid. The schedule goes on to mention, the type of policy, on the happening of which, the sum assured is payable and to whom it is payable. It of course also mentions when and how long the premium is to be paid.\\nThe policy document is signed by an official of the insurer and dated and stamped as per the provision of the Stamp Act to make it a completely legally enforceable document.\\nAn assignment of a policy in favour of another person or institution can be effected by an endorsement on the policy. Re-assignment can also be done by a subsequent endorsement on the same policy.As a nomination is automatically cancelled due to an assignment, after re-assignment, it is necessary to make a fresh nomination.\\nIn Duplicate policy a policy document is a valuable document and can be used for mortgage etc. Loss of policy document does not absolve the insurer from the liability of payment of policy proceeds when the claim arises. The claim can be settled on the claimants, furnishing an indemnity bond jointly with one surety.\\nIf a policy is irrevocably lost, a duplicate policy can be issued, after following a certain procedure like the insurer satisfies itself of the circumstances leading to loss and being so satisfied the insurer insists upon an advertisement in a news paper, production of an indemnity bond and payment of policy preparation charges and there after a duplicate policy is issued.\\nGenerally nomination is made at the time of taking a policy. In case it is not done, it is possible to make nomination subsequently by an endorsement on the policy. It is also possible to change a nomination subsequently by an endorsement. After marriage, such change in nomination is normally required.\\nLife insurance being a legally enforceable contract, needs to be documented with details of the rights and obligations of the parties to the contract. Proposal form duly filled in and signed by the proposer is the first document which forms the basis of the contract.\\nEvery time, the insured pays the premium, he receives a premium receipt. The premium needs to be paid in time, non- payment of premium leads to policy-lapses. Re-instatement of the cover is called revival of the policy.\\nIf the policy is not revived, the policy can become a paid up policy for a reduced sum assured under certain conditions.\\nThe policy document mentions in detail all the rights and obligations of the policyholder. The agent is advised to explain the various provisions of the policy to the policyholder.\\nThe wordings in the policy document are of technical nature and hence the need for explaining. If there are certain endorsements on the policy, that need to be explained too.\\nIt needs to be explained that the policy is a valuable document and needs to be kept in safe custody and in the knowledge of the close relatives.\\n'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":23}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"id":"7fcbVFo2qsFb","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1619460949612,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1707,"user":{"displayName":"SATYAM

The development of a robust manufacturing sector continues to be a key priority of the Indian Government. It was one of the first 'Vocal for Local' initiatives that exposed India's manufacturing domain to the world. The sector has the potential to not only take economic growth to a higher trajectory but also to provide employment to a large pool of our young labour force.\n","Make in India initiative has made significant achievements and presently focuses on 27 sectors under Make in India 2.0. Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade is coordinating action plans for manufacturing sectors, while Department of Commerce is coordinating service sectors.\n","The Government of India is making continuous efforts under Investment Facilitation for implementation of Make in India action plans to identify potential investors. Support is being provided to Indian Missions abroad and State Governments for organising events, summits, road-shows and other promotional activities to attract investment in the country under the Make in India banner. Investment Outreach activities are being carried out for enhancing International co-operation for promoting FDI and improve Ease of Doing Business in the country.\n","India has registered its highest ever annual FDI Inflow of US $74.39 billion (provisional figure) during the last financial year 2019-20 as compared to US $ 45.15 billion in 2014-2015. In the last six financial years (2014-20), India has received FDI inflow worth US$ 358.30 billion which is 53 percent of the FDI reported in the last 20 years (US$ 681.87 billion).\n","Steps taken to improve Ease of Doing Business include simplification and rationalization of existing processes. As a result of the measures taken to improve the country’s investment climate, India jumped to 63rd place in World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business ranking as per World Bank’s Doing Business Report (DBR) 2020. This is driven by reforms in the areas of Starting a Business, Paying Taxes, Trading Across Borders, and Resolving Insolvency.\n","Recently, Government has taken various steps in addition to ongoing schemes to boost domestic and foreign investments in India. These include the National Infrastructure Pipeline, Reduction in Corporate Tax, easing liquidity problems of NBFCs and Banks, policy measures to boost domestic manufacturing. Government of India has also promoted domestic manufacturing of goods through public procurement orders, Phased Manufacturing Programme (PMP), Schemes for Production Linked Incentives of various Ministries.\n","Further, with a view to support, facilitate and provide investor friendly ecosystem to investors investing in India, the Union Cabinet on 03rd June, 2020 has approved constitution of an Empowered Group of Secretaries (EGoS), and also Project Development Cells (PDCs) in all concerned Ministries/ Departments to fast-track investments in coordination between the Central Government and State Governments, and thereby grow the pipeline of investible projects in India to increase domestic investments and FDI inflow.\n","The activities under the Make in India initiative are being undertaken by several Central Government Ministries/ Departments and various State Governments. Further, Ministries formulate action plans, programmes, schemes and policies for the sectors being dealt by them. This Department does not maintain information on such formulations by the line ministries.\"\"\""],"execution_count":33,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"x3oyVxtxjL0k","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1619460995608,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1811,"user":{"displayName":"SATYAM SONI","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhG4rcPYa7hnDqGvLTYPIBiXe9m-k4IPTmu9dWD=s64","userId":"06127152709350492896"}}},"source":["question_fdi = \"What were the various steps taken by the government to boost domestic and foreign investment in India?\""],"execution_count":34,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"4bBEjtSRPlF7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1619461056836,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":60356,"user":{"displayName":"SATYAM SONI","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhG4rcPYa7hnDqGvLTYPIBiXe9m-k4IPTmu9dWD=s64","userId":"06127152709350492896"}},"outputId":"b9a3cc7b-1b8b-4d84-b6b3-4e5bc4e42e3b"},"source":["max_score = 0;\n","final_answer = \"\"\n","new_df = expand_split_sentences(fdi)\n","for new_context in new_df:\n","  #new_paragrapgh = new_paragrapgh + answer_question(question, answer_text)\n","  ans, score = answer_question(question_fdi, new_context)\n","  if score > max_score:\n","    max_score = score\n","    final_answer = ans\n","print(final_answer)\n","print(max_score)"],"execution_count":35,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Token indices sequence length is longer than the specified maximum sequence length for this model (522 > 512).
